Resources meant for modifying the text in the SFC/SNES games *Panel de Pon* and *Tetris Attack*.

## Status
Priority right now for me is **Tetris Attack > Panepon (fan-translation) > Panepon (vanilla)**

I have no experience with Japanese, so Panel de Pon is specially tricky for me.
### Panel de Pon
 * Panel de Pon [Zuqkeo].tbl (Fan-translation)
   * Some characters identified.
### Tetris Attack
(should also apply to Yoshi no Panepon, same game)
 * Tetris Attack.tbl
   * Missing some characters. Was once seperated into English and Japanese, before the encoding format was fully figured out.

## TO-DO
* Figure out the pointer tables for both games. (Help needed)
* ~Figure out abcde and Atlas.~ (Not using them anymore; instead I'm writing my own tool)
* Japanese character tables for both games.
* ~Update "Usage" section of this README.~ (Removed for now)
